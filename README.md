vagrant-octopress-TorunJUG
==========================

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) setup files for blogging with [Octopress](http://octopress.org) which I'm using to manage [Toru≈Ñ JUG](http://torun.jug.pl) site.

With a few small modifications it can be applied to any site based on Octopress project. 

I wrote a little about this topic in Polish on my [blog](http://prondzyn.com/2014/12/05/przygotowanie-vagranta-do-blogowania-z-octopressem/).
